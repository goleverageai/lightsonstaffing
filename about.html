                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Lights on Staffing was founded with a simple yet powerful vision: to bridge the gap between exceptional talent and outstanding opportunities. In today's competitive marketplace, we recognized that traditional recruitment approaches often fall short of creating meaningful, lasting connections.</p>
                        <p>Our journey began with the understanding that every individual has unique strengths and every organization has distinct needs. By taking the time to truly understand both sides of the equation, we've built a reputation for creating matches that go beyond surface-level qualifications to forge partnerships that drive mutual success.</p>
                        <p>What sets us apart is our commitment to building relationships, not just filling positions. We believe that the right placement can transform a career trajectory and elevate an entire organization's performance.</p>
