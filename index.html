        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Lights on Staffing is led by Steven Glynn, hailing from Ireland originally, I came to the US with a Dream & a Greencard! Career #1 was Environmental Engineering and after 4 years of that I took a leap of faith and asked my recruiter if I could work for their company. I was in Corporate recruiting for 16 years before venturing out on my own in 2019. Still going strong. The secret sauce? There is a secret sauce - let's chat and allow me to share.</p>
