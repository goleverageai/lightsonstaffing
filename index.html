      <h2><!-- Who We Are</h2>
      <p><!-- ALights on Staffing is led by Steven Glynn, hailing from Ireland originally, I came to the US with a Dream & a Greencard! Career #1 was Environmental Engineering and after 4 years of that I took a leap of faith and asked my recruiter if I could work for their company. I was in Corporate recruiting for 16 years before venturing out on my own in 2019. Still going strong. The secret sauce? There is a secret sauce - lets chat and allow me to share.</p>

      It's a partnership. We work hand-in-hand with our clients from the outset of the recruitment process, beginning with an in-depth analysis of your organization's unique needs, company culture, and business goals. Need 8 to 40 hours of support - try this. Customized and the cheapest option around. Not ready to commit to a full-time recruiter, try this.

      If you prefer a contingency approach. Have a once off Requirement or want to "Try before you buy", this is a good way to consider. It's the old school approach - you only pay when we find the candidate.
